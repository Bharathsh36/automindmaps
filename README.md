# A tiny personal project to convert text into a mind map

Currently using Ruby on Rails 5 framework to build this app.

**Things it should solve**

* Take raw text or pdf file from the user
* Tokenize the text into important key words
* Map the words in th form of mind map
* Convert the mindmap to png or jpg or store it in user's profile for future refernce.

**Why**
It would help people (students) to understand and revise the subjects/books easily.
